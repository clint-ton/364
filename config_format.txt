====================================

config file format examples (bits in brackets are comments):


router-id 1   		     (1-64000 unique)

input-ports 6110 6201 7345   (1024-64000, port numbers only occur once, port numbers correspond to the number of neighbours a router has)

outputs 5000-1-1 5002-5-4    (contact information for neighboured routers, (neighbours input port that it listens to the current router from)-(metric value of link)-(router-id of peer)
			      metric value is 1-15, 16 is infinity, no listed output ports should be the same as any listed input or output ports)

timer-values 30-180-120      (timer values in the standard are 30s for an update, 180s for a timeout, and 120s for garbage collection. Timer values must be set to a ratio of these 3)

====================================

If a parameter is correctly specified multiple times, the first instance of that parameter is used.
The uniqueness of the router ID must be specified manually, as well as the uniqueness of the ports in relation to other host config files
Two neighbouring routers must also have an input port listed as an output port of the other
